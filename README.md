# Deep learning and communication theory

explain information flow in DNN via information theory, information bottleneck

## Getting Started

### Literature Review

- 2018/01/22-23. **The information bottleneck method** Naftali Tishby, Fernando C. Pereira, and William Bialek1

Well explain Blahut-Arimoto algorithm and the information bottleneck. 

- 2018/01/24 **Deep Learning and the Information Bottleneck Principle** Naftali Tishby and Noga Zaslavsky1

Connect DNN with IB, any DNN can be quantified by the mutual information bewteen hidden layers and input/output variables.
